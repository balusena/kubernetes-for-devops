# kubernetes Ingress
In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object that acts as a front-end to route external traffic to services
running within the cluster. It serves as a gateway or entry point for external clients to access the services
running on the cluster nodes. In simple terms, Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes and manages the traffic
flow to different backend services based on a set of predefined rules.

Kubernetes Ingress is a resource to add rules to route traffic from external sources to the applications 
running in the kubernetes cluster.

# What is Kubernetes Ingress?

It is the same in the Kubernetes world as well. Ingress means the traffic that enters the cluster and egress
is the traffic that exits the cluster.
