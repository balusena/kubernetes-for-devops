# Introduction to YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
YAML is a human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files and data 
exchange between languages with different data structures. It is known for its simplicity and readability, 
emphasizing data over document markup.

## Key Features

### 1.Human-Readable
YAML syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, with a minimalistic style that avoids the complexity of XML or JSON.

### 2.Data Structures
YAML supports complex data structures like lists, dictionaries (mappings), and scalars (strings, numbers, booleans).

### 3.Indentation-Based
YAML uses indentation to denote structure, making it visually clear. Consistent indentation is crucial.

### 4.Support for Comments
Comments in YAML start with a `#`, allowing for documentation within configuration files.

### 5.Flexible and Powerful
It can represent a wide range of data types and supports references and anchors to avoid redundancy.

#Serialization:

              Serialization                                            Deserialization
Source ----------------------------> [0011000100011100000001] -------------------------------> Destination 

           {                                  Network
             "name": "John",
             "age": 30,
             "city": "New York"
           }

* The process of converting an object to binary is called serialization.

* The process of converting binary back to the original data is called deserialization.

## Different serialization languages:

## YAML
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. It emphasizes simplicity and
readability, using indentation to represent data structures like lists and dictionaries. YAML is ideal for 
configuration files due to its clear syntax and ease of editing. It is less verbose compared to XML, making 
it more user-friendly.
```
clusters:
  - name: "local-cluster"
    driver: docker
    isActive: true
    version: 1.31.1
    nodes: 2
  - name: "dev-cluster"
    driver: docker
    is Active: true
    version: 1.31.1
    nodes: 2
```

## JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used in web applications. 
It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON structures data as
key-value pairs and arrays, making it a popular choice for APIs and web services due to its simplicity and 
compactness.
```
{
 "cluster": [
    {
      "name": "local-cluster",
      "driver": "docker",
      "isActive": true,
      "version": "1.31.1",
      "nodes": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "dev-cluster",
      "driver": "docker",
      "isActive": true,
      "version": "1.31.1",
      "nodes": 2
    }
  }
}    
```

## XML
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format 
that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML uses tags to structure data, which can be verbose. It 
is highly flexible and supports complex data structures, but it is often considered less user-friendly 
compared to YAML and JSON.
```
<clusters>
...
  <cluster>
    <name>local-cluster</name>
    <driver>docker</docker>
    <isActive>true</isActive>
    <version>1.31.1</version>
    <nodes>2</nodes>
  </cluster> 
  <cluster>
    <name>dev-cluster</name>
    <driver>docker</docker>
    <isActive>true</isActive>
    <version>1.31.1</version>
    <nodes>2</nodes>
  </cluster>      
</clusters>  
```
**Summary:**
YAML is a data-oriented format, designed for readability and ease of use, making it ideal for configuration
files. Unlike markup languages, YAML’s simple syntax enhances human readability and reduces complexity. 
This makes YAML particularly suited for configuration files where clarity is crucial. Additionally, YAML 
and JSON’s compatibility with source control systems like GitHub ensures that configuration changes are 
easily trackable and auditable. By using YAML, teams benefit from both a user-friendly format and robust 
version control, facilitating better management and transparency of configuration files across development 
environments.
