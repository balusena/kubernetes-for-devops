# kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes are resources for managing configuration and sensitive data,respectively. 

**ConfigMaps** is used to store non-sensitive data like environment variables, command-line arguments, and 
configuration files, separating configuration from application code.

**Secrets** are designed for securely storing confidential information like passwords, API tokens, and certificates.
Secrets provide an extra layer of security compared to plain text, making them suitable for sensitive data. 

## 1.ConfigMaps
- ConfigMaps in Kubernetes is an API object that allows you to store and manage configuration data separately 
  from your application code.
- They provide a way to supply configuration information to containers, pods, or even entire deployments, 
  without requiring changes to the application itself.
- ConfigMaps play a crucial role in maintaining flexibility, portability, and separation of concerns within a
  Kubernetes environment.

**The primary purpose of ConfigMaps is to decouple configuration settings from application logic. This 
separation offers several benefits:**

- **1.Flexibility:** ConfigMaps enable easy modification of configuration parameters without the need to modify and redeploy your application. This is particularly useful when transitioning between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) or when tuning application behavior.

- **2.Collaboration:** Teams can collaborate effectively by modifying ConfigMaps without interfering with application code, promoting smoother DevOps practices.

- **3.Kubernetes-native:** ConfigMaps integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, making them a natural fit for configuration management within the container orchestration ecosystem.

ConfigMaps can contain simple key-value pairs or even entire configuration files, which are mounted as 
volumes or accessed as environment variables by pods. They can be created declaratively using YAML manifests
or through imperative commands.

In summary, ConfigMaps empowers Kubernetes users to manage configuration data in a flexible, modular, and 
scalable manner, ensuring that applications are easily adaptable to varying environments and operational 
requirements.
