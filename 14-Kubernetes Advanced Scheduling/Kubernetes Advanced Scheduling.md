# Kubernetes Advanced Scheduling
Kubernetes advanced scheduling optimizes pod placement and resource management. Node Name and Node Selector assign pods 
to specific nodes or those with certain labels. Node Affinity provides flexible rules for node selection based on labels.
Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity dictates how pods should be scheduled in relation to other pods. Taints and Tolerations control
pod placement on nodes with specific taints. Together, these features enhance resource efficiency, balance workloads, and
meet precise deployment needs.
