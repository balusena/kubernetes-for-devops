# kubernetes Resource Management
Kubernetes resource management involves controlling the allocation of compute resources like CPU and memory to containers
within a cluster. It uses requests to reserve resources and limits to cap usage, ensuring efficient utilization. Resource
quotas can restrict overall usage across namespaces, while limits ranges control resource limits per container. Kubernetes
also supports auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on demand, maintaining optimal performance and
cost-efficiency in cloud-native environments.
